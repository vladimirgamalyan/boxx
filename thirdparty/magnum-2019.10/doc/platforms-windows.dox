@section platforms-windows-hidpi HiDPI support

Windows supports two approaches to advertising HiDPI support. The recommended
way is via a so-called manifest file added to an executable, but it's also
possible to it programatically through the `SetProcessDpiAwareness()` family of
APIs. Note there's three different levels of DPI awareness setup for Windows
Vista and newer, Windows 8.1 and newer and Windows 10, and for best support may
want to support all three.

When using MSVC, the manifest file can be added directly via CMake. Advertising application-wide per-monitor support can look like in the following snippet,
together with fallbacks for older systems:

@code{.xml}
<assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0"
          xmlns:asmv3="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3">
<asmv3:application>
  <asmv3:windowsSettings>
    <dpiAware xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2005/WindowsSettings">
      true/pm
    </dpiAware> <!-- legacy -->
    <dpiAwareness xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2016/WindowsSettings">
      permonitorv2,permonitor
    </dpiAwareness> <!-- falls back to pm if pmv2 is not available -->
  </asmv3:windowsSettings>
</asmv3:application>
</assembly>
@endcode

Then, the manifest file can be supplied directly in the sources list for
@cmake add_executable() @ce, via a variable, or you can add it conditionally
later using @cmake target_sources() @ce. For example:

@code{.cmake}
add_executable(my-application MyApplication.cpp)
if(CORRADE_TARGET_WINDOWS)
    target_sources(my-application PRIVATE WindowsHiDPI.manifest)
endif()
@endcode

Some toolkits (such as GLFW in @ref Platform-GlfwApplication-dpi "Platform::GlfwApplication")
are advertising HiDPI support implicitly programatically. In that case the
manifest file doesn't need to be supplied, but there may be some disadvantages
compared to supplying the manifest. See the
[MSDN documentation about DPI awareness](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/mt846517(v=vs.85).aspx)
for more information.

@m_class{m-block m-info}

@par Supplying manifests with MinGW
    With MinGw the operation is slightly more involved, as you need to pass it
    through a `*.rc` file. A downside is that MinGW is not able to merge
    information from multiple manifests like the MSVC toolchain can.
@par
    @code{.txt}
    1 RT_MANIFEST "WindowsHiDPI.manifest"
    @endcode
@par
    Then you add the `*.rc` file using @cb{.cmake} target_sources @ce like
    above. Here's a CMake snippet that will work for both:
@par
    @code{.cmake}
    add_executable(my-application MyApplication.cpp)
    if(CORRADE_TARGET_WINDOWS)
        if(MSVC)
            target_sources(my-application PRIVATE WindowsHiDPI.manifest)
        elif(MINGW)
            target_sources(my-application PRIVATE WindowsHiDPI.rc)
        endif()
    endif()
    @endcode

@section platforms-windows-unicode Unicode support

Windows is the only major platform that forces developers into UTF-16. This
presents several challenges, however Magnum tries to shield users from this as
much as possible:

-   All Magnum APIs work with strings encoded as UTF-8, converting to UTF-16
    behind the scenes if necessary
-   If you use @ref Corrade::Utility::Directory instead of C file APIs or
    @ref std::fstream, all filesystem operations are Unicode-aware, working
    with paths encoded in UTF-8
-   All Magnum APIs operating with files (@ref Trade::AbstractImporter::openFile(),
    @ref GL::Shader::addFile(), ...) use @ref Corrade::Utility::Directory
    underneath, meaning you're implicitly Unicode-aware as long as you use
    Magnum APIs
-   @ref Corrade::Utility::Arguments expose environment variables as UTF-8,
    decoding them from UTF-16 input on Windows
-   And finally, for Unicode-aware console I/O and command-line arguments,
    simply link to the @ref main "Corrade::Main" library, which will do needed
    conversion implicitly for you

@section platform-windows-terminal-colors Colored terminal output

There's two options for colored terminal output --- either using the classic
Windows API (which is the default), or making use of the ANSI color escape
codes compatible with all Unix systems. The former has a restriction that it
works only when printing directly to the terminal (so your colors will get lost
if you redirect to a file). The latter is available only in Windows 10, has to
be explicitly enabled using @ref CORRADE_UTILITY_USE_ANSI_COLORS when building
Corrade and additionally requires an explicit setup during application startup.
This setup is done when you link to the @ref main "Corrade::Main" library, see
its documentation for more information.

@section platform-windows-hiding-console Hiding console window

By default, CMake compiles GUI applications with a potentially unwanted
console window lurking in the background. This can be fixed by creating your
executable with @cmake add_executable(... WIN32 ...) @ce and linking to the
@ref main "Corrade::Main" library. See its documentation for more information.

@section platforms-windows-rt Windows RT

Windows RT is a restricted subset of Windows API, used for UWP / "Metro" /
Windows Store apps. The major difference is lack of access to APIs that are
common in Win32 world, such as memory-mapped files, DLLs or environment
variables.

In particular, Windows RT doesn't provide a direct access to OpenGL, the only
possibility to use it is through ANGLE. See @ref building-windows-angle and
@ref platforms-gl-es-angle for more information.

For Windows RT you need to provide logo images and splash screen, all
referenced from the `*.appxmanifest` file. The file is slightly different for
different targets, template for Windows Store and MSVC 2013 is below, others
are in the @ref Platform-Sdl2Application-bootstrap-winrt "SDL2 bootstrap application".

@code{.xml}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Package xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/2010/manifest"
         xmlns:m2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/2013/manifest">
  <Identity Name="MyApplication" Publisher="CN=A Publisher" Version="1.1.0.0" />
  <Properties>
    <DisplayName>My Application</DisplayName>
    <PublisherDisplayName>A Publisher</PublisherDisplayName>
    <Logo>assets/logo-store.png</Logo>
  </Properties>
  <Resources>
    <Resource Language="x-generate" />
  </Resources>
  <Applications>
    <Application Id="App" Executable="$targetnametoken$.exe"
                 EntryPoint="MyApplication.App">
      <m2:VisualElements
        DisplayName="Magnum Windows Store Application"
        Description="My Application"
        BackgroundColor="#202020"
        ForegroundText="light"
        Square150x150Logo="assets/logo.png"
        Square30x30Logo="assets/logo-small.png">
        <m2:SplashScreen Image="assets/splash.png" />
      </m2:VisualElements>
    </Application>
  </Applications>
</Package>
@endcode

The assets are referenced also from the main `CMakeLists.txt` file. You have to
mark all non-source files (except for the `*.pfx` key) with `VS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT`
property and optionally set their location with `VS_DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION`. If
you are using `*.resw` files, these need to have the `VS_TOOL_OVERRIDE`
property set to `PRIResource`.

@section platforms-windows-msvc-version-mapping MSVC version mapping

MSVC and Visual Studio use three, er, four different versioning schemes. CMake
exposes compiler version equivalent to the `_MSC_VER` macro, see this
[handy Wikipedia table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_C%2B%2B#Internal_version_numbering)
for mapping to Visual Studio versions. For example, a check for MSVC 2017
would look like this:

@code{.cmake}
if(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "MSVC" AND NOT
   CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_VERSION VERSION_LESS "19.10")
    # Code requiring MSVC 2017
endif()
@endcode

@note CMake supports `VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL` in the @cb{.cmake} if() @ce
    statement only [since version 3.7](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/3.7.html#commands),
    use a negated `VERSION_LESS` like above in older versions.

@see @ref platforms-macos-clang-version-mapping

@section platforms-windows-troubleshooting Troubleshooting

@subsection platforms-windows-troubleshooting-ninja-includes Ninja spams the output with tons of include file notices

This happens when you have a non-English locale of Visual Studio installed and
apart from the spammy output it will probably cause incremental builds to not
correctly rebuild files after a header change. A workaround is to uninstall the
current locale and install the English one instead, additionally you have to
recreate your build directory. See [ninja-build/ninja#613](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/issues/613)
for more information.

@subsection platforms-windows-troubleshooting-file-encoding Code page warnings with MSVC

On some Windows systems with non-English locales, a warning similar to the
following might come up, emitted for practically any Magnum header:

@m_class{m-console-wrap}

@code{.shell-session}
src\Corrade/Utility/Debug.h : warning C4819: The file contains a character that cannot be represented in the current code page (949). Save the file in Unicode format to prevent data loss
@endcode

This is due to Visual Studio expecting header files in your system locale. All
Magnum headers are *deliberately* containing UTF-8 characters (usually at least
the `©` character in the license block) in order to prevent encoding errors in
3rd party contributions. Solution is to convert your source files to UTF-8 as
well, and, if the warning doesn't go away, add `/utf-8` to `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`
--- either on the command line / via CMake GUI, or by directly adding the flag
to your project's CMakeLists (useful if your whole team suffers from this
problem). See https://stackoverflow.com/a/37872393 for more information.

@code{.cmake}
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} /utf-8")
@endcode

@subsection platform-windows-troubleshooting-default-project The ALL_BUILD project can't be executed

When CMake generates Visual Studio projects, it will set `ALL_BUILD` as a
default project. This can be annoying since the `ALL_BUILD` can be only built
but not executed, and thus pressing *Build & Run* will fail with an error. A
workaround is to right-click the actual executable target (such as
`MyApplication`) and select *Set as Startup Project*. With CMake 3.6 and newer,
this can be also changed by setting the [VS_STARTUP_PROJECT](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_dir/VS_STARTUP_PROJECT.html)
property for the project directory:

@code{.cmake}
add_executable(MyApplication ...)
set_property(DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} PROPERTY VS_STARTUP_PROJECT MyApplication)
@endcode

The Magnum bootstrap projects set this automatically.
